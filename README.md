<h1>Configuring RAID 5</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I learned to configure RAID 5. RAID stands for redundant array of independent disks. It is the technique of using different types of data backup techniques like striping, mirroring, or parity. RAID has different levels and RAID 5 is one of them. RAID 5 uses a distributed parity backup technique. RAID 5 needs a minimum of 3 hard disks.
